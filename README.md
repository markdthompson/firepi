# FirePi
IoT Raspberry Pi application programming interface enabling remote GPIO control and real time sensor reads through the Firebase realtime database.

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to create a scaffold from which to construct networked IoT services on top of Raspberry Pi and Firebase. It should provide for app-based, real time sensor reads and remote GPIO control writes.

## Requirements
This project runs on Raspberry Pi and requires:
* Python 3
* Flask
* Firebase Admin SDK
